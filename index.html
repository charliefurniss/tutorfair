			<h1 id="title">About us</h1>
			<h4 id="intro-text">Tutorfair was founded with a simple idea and a promise. We offer an easy way to find the best tutors, while giving free tutoring to students who need it most.</h4>
			<p id="main-text">Tutorfair is a team of parents, tutors and web entrepreneurs, and we're on a mission to help kids succeed. We are excited by what is happening with tutoring. More and more people are getting their own tutor. That is because it works, and it can be tailored to each person. You really can learn whatever you want. We believe that tutoring should be for all so the Tutorfair Foundation arranges free tuition for children who can't afford it.</p>
